Project title : Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms 
Algorithms : Decision tree, random forest, naive bayes 
Input : 3 symptoms should be taken from the user 
Output : disease related to those 3 symptoms should be printed using every algorithm 
Requirements : 
1) Accuracy of each algorithm should be greater than 93% 
2) For taking input a GUI should be created which should have three text boxes which takes 3 symptoms and should have 
three buttons for three algorithms. By clicking each button the disease related to that should be printed using that 
algorithm
